Hi. This is a first post.

I keep thinking I'll start writing, and I keep putting it off. I'm going to give it a go here.

In the last few days I've been re-reading the first chapter of [Elements of Programming](http://elementsofprogramming.com) by Alexander Stepanov and Paul McJones. This book is (I think) pretty well known in C++ circles, but I'm not sure it's well known _outside_ those circles.

Alexander Stepanov was an early advocate of [generic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming) and was the primary designer and implmenter of the C++ Standard Template Library.

Anyways... the books is pretty dense, and latter parts are not necessarily that easy to get through. I've usually dropped off at some point in the third chapter in previous attempts to read through it.

The first chapter, called "Foundations" is a great overview of basic, foundational ideas in computer programming. Even if you only ever read the first chapter, I think it's valuable, and I highly recommend it.

All right; happy holidays!
